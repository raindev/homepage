# My blog about all sorts of stuff

The blog is generated using [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll) and hosted
with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). The theme is inspired by [this
website](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com). GitHub CSS ribbon is from
[github-fork-ribbon-css](https://simonwhitaker.github.io/github-fork-ribbon-css).

All the source of the blog resides inside src/, all the actual content is in
the top level directory.

To build the site you should [install
Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/tutorials/01-installation.html) first and
execute `make`. To run the site locally use `make run`.
