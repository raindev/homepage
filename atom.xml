<p>TL;DR macOS expects 200 MB EFI System partition in the beginning of a hard drive, don’t like unformatted partitions and creates 128 MB Apple boot partitions after each real partition whenever you format it.</p>
<p>I needed to partition an external hard drive to be usable on macOS (for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Machine_(macOS)">Time Machine</a> backups). I’ve partitioned the drive using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table">GPT</a> scheme and created one unformatted Apple HFS/HFS+ partition on Arch Linux using <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fdisk">fdisk</a>. It was not recognized (the inserted disk is not readable dialogue), nor was I able to format the partition (with “Media kit reports not enough space on device” error) which was shown as full in the Disk Utility. When I have formatted the partition (using mkfs.hfsplus from <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/hfsprogs/">hfsprogs</a>) the partition was recognized but I was unable to initialize it for Time Machine or format with the same error as before. Finally I have partitioned the drive from macOS and created a new partition. Looking at the drive with fdisk I’ve discovered that EFI System partition was created in the beginning of the disk with size of 200MB. When I have recreated the same partitioning layout using fdisk it was recognized properly. After setting up Time Machine backups on the created partition I have inspected the disk once more. The partition type was changed to Apple core storage and a 128 MB partition was created after it. When I created another partition for the second MacBook I got one more 125 MB Apple boot partition. The resulting partition table was:</p>
<pre><code>Device         Start       End   Sectors  Size Type
/dev/sdb1       2048    411647    409600  200M EFI System
/dev/sdb2     411648 268847103 268435456  128G Apple Core storage
/dev/sdb3  268847104 269109247    262144  128M Apple boot
/dev/sdb4  269109248 478824447 209715200  100G Apple Core storage
/dev/sdb5  478824448 479086591    262144  128M Apple boot</code></pre>
<p>So 5 partitions instead of 2 I actually needed. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/technotes/tn2166/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS10003927-CH1-SUBSECTION5">Here</a> Apple’s partitioning policy can be found describing when additional partitions are created with some justifications trying to answer why they are needed.</p>

    <title>What's Wrong with WhatsApp Message Tunneling</title>

<p>A colleague asked me on Twitter what the problems do I have with the way WhatsApp tunnels all the messages though my phone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/raindev_/status/859872365886545920">@raindev_</a>: I’m tired of WhatsApp tunneling all the messages through my phone. Time to look for an alternative?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JensRantil/status/861205974933270528">@JensRantil</a>: Also, what part about the tunneling do you find annoying? Very rarely don’t I have my phone on same Wi-Fi as computer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer turned out to be too long for Twitter so I decided to write a short post.</p>
<p>Just to clarify: it’s not required for the phone to be on the same Wi-Fi network, being connected to the Internet is enough.</p>
<p>While that’s true that most of the time my phone is connected, I have a few issue with this approach.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>I doesn’t work truly reliably. Sometimes I need to wake up my phone to connect/reconnect to WhatsApp from the desktop.</p></li>
<li><p>It drains phone battery unnecessarily. Especially if I’m connected to WhatsApp the whole day, e.g. at an office. While the impact may not be huge really, I don’t see a reason to sacrifice part of already scarce phone battery life.</p></li>
<li><p>My phone isn’t really <em>always</em> connected. I don’t want to fall offline if I forgot a charger/to charge/or my phone altogether. Made worse by the fact that I need to scan a barcode from the phone to connect which is awkward to do remotely.</p></li>
<li><p>Because all the messages have to be tunneled though my specific device, I can’t use WhatsApp on two different phones at the same time. Yes, I do use two phones regularly.</p></li>
<li><p>If phone is offline, there’s no access to old messages as all of them are stored on the phone only.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, while not directly caused by the tunneling, but tied together with the decision to do authentication by phone number: impossible to log out a device remotely, I’d better not loose my phone; lack of iPad app, is probably a result of the same decision line.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>While all of the issues above are not critical (in fact I’ve used WhatsApp as my main messenger successfully for more than a year), they makes me look at alternatives time to time (the current contender is <a href="https://wire.com">Wire</a>).</p>

<h1 id="part-2-getting-work-done-from-console">Part 2: Getting Work Done from Console</h1>
<p>This is the second part of <a href="/build-yourself-arch-linux-1.html">the series of articles</a> about setting up Arch Linux on my MacBook. The main goal of this part is to make the installation actually useful to do some work. In some sense, I want to bootstrap the series to be able to work on the posts under Linux. Disclaimer: I won’t get to setting up graphical environment in this part; while it’s possible to do everything from this article <em>after</em> installing a graphical environment, I’ve decided to try how far can I get without one.</p>
<h2 id="unprivileged-user">Unprivileged user</h2>
<p>It is <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/192365/is-it-ok-to-use-the-root-user-as-a-normal-user/192422#192422">not a good idea</a> to use a computer as root user all the time. <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Users_and_groups#User_management">Here</a> is how to create a new unprivileged user and set its password. Beware that a user’s home directory is created from a template called skeleton and the default skeleton (<code>/etc/skel</code>) contains only a few basic dotfiles templates like <code>.bashrc</code>. It may be confusing if you used to see bunch of predefined media directories in your home catalogue.</p>
<h3 id="sudo">sudo</h3>
<p><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Sudo">sudo</a> is another recommended security measure. It is not pre-installed, you’ll need to get it with <code>pacman</code>. I used group <code>wheel</code> to give access to <code>sudo</code>. The newly created user needs to be added the group. <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Sudo#Using_visudo"><code>visudo</code></a> is the way to control access to <code>sudo</code> command. Besides giving <code>wheel</code> members privileged access I also allowed reboot/shutdown to be performed without need for the password. To do that while editing <code>/etc/sudoers</code> I have uncommented the line with <code>Cmd_Alias</code> for <code>REBOOT</code> and added the following line:<code>raindev ALL= NOPASSWD: REBOOT</code>. Now I can run <code>sudo poweroff</code> to shutdown my laptop and won’t be asked for the password. The same way user can be given a permission to execute other commands requiring privilege escalation without a password.</p>
<h3 id="polkit">polkit</h3>
<p>Another option to access power management without need for a password is <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Polkit"><code>polkit</code></a> which is a framework for granular access management. Given <code>polkit</code> is installed and running (I had to reboot before <code>systemctl start polkit</code> succeeded), you’ll be able to use <code>systemctl reboot/poweroff/suspend</code> without password given that there’re no other users logged in.</p>
<h3 id="automatic-login">Automatic login</h3>
<p>Considering that disk encryption password is required to boot there’s no point in having to enter user’s password every time to log in. The program that manages virtual terminals and their access is called getty. Read <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Agetty#Automatic_login_to_virtual_console">ArchWiki</a> for how to configure automatic login for getty.</p>
<h2 id="unplugging-the-laptop">Unplugging the laptop</h2>
<h3 id="wi-fi">Wi-Fi</h3>
<p>To get Wi-Fi working a driver is needed. The problem is my Wi-Fi card (Broadcom BCM4360) is not supported by the kernel itself and there’s no driver available from official Arch Linux repositories. Good news are that almost any package you may need is available from <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Aur">Arch User Repository</a> if not found in the official repositories. <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Broadcom#broadcom-wl"><code>broadcom-wl-dkms</code></a> is the package we need (update: has been moved into the official community repository). It’s a good idea to install <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/DKMS">DKMS</a> version of the driver to not have to recompile it manually after each kernel upgrade. You’ll need to get <code>dkms</code> package before installing the driver. There’re two ways of installing AUR packages: <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Aur#Installing_packages">manual</a> or using <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_helpers#Build_and_search">AUR helpers</a>. I use <a href="https://github.com/rmarquis/pacaur">pacaur</a> but installing packages manually is not that hard and inspecting package files can provide useful insights when there’re some problems. Do not forget to install <code>base-devel</code> package group as the build will fail without it.</p>
<p>When the wireless driver is installed the only thing left is to get <code>dialog</code> and <code>wpa_supplicant</code> packages which are needed to be able to use <code>wifi-menu</code> tool. Connecting to wireless networks is dead simple: <code>sudo wifi-menu</code>. Give the profile meaningful name, it will be possible to quickly activate it using <code>sudo netctl start &lt;profile&gt;</code>.</p>
<h3 id="brightness-and-battery-level">Brightness and battery level</h3>
<p>Besides Wi-Fi two things where bothering me while working off the table: how to change screen brightness and check battery charge. The answer is using files :) After some exploration in <code>/sys/class</code> I’ve found <code>/sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness</code> (or <code>/sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness</code> if you prefer percentage instead of absolute brightness value) and <code>/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/capacity</code>. They are just files, you can read them and write to them (battery charge is obviously read-only). Don’t be afraid to look into your <code>/sys/class</code>, there’re lots of interesting stuff. You can enable adjustment of brightness without need for a password the same way as done for power management above using <code>visudo</code>. E.g. I use <code>cat 200 &gt; sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness</code> (notice placement of <code>sudo</code>), therefore <code>NOPASSWD</code> should be set for <code>tee /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness</code>.</p>
<h3 id="color-scheme-and-cursor">Color scheme and cursor</h3>
<p>On the laptop’s screen I have found colors to be hard to read (especially in command line browsers). I have found Solarized color scheme adapted for Linux virtual console <a href="https://github.com/altercation/solarized/issues/294#issuecomment-55518384">here</a>. It made the terminal much more comfortable for the eyes. While at console configuration, I have also changed cursor to not blink and to be a nice solid light grey block. Read <a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/55423/how-to-change-cursor-shape-color-and-blinkrate-of-linux-console/158305#158305">this StackOverflow answer</a> for a quick solution (I have used <code>16;0;224</code> cursor configuration values); read man page for <code>terminfo</code> for details.</p>
<h2 id="blogging-toolchain">Blogging toolchain</h2>
<p>The first thing I have decided to configure my new Arch Linux installation for is blogging. I use <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll">Hakyll</a> static website generator and host my blog using <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
<h3 id="web-browser-w3m">Web browser: w3m</h3>
<p>To work on my blog I need a web browser obviously. Out of curiosity I have decide to see how far can I get using a terminal browser. I have tried three options: <a href="http://lynx.invisible-island.net">Lynx</a>, <a href="http://elinks.or.cz">ELinks</a> and <a href="http://w3m.sourceforge.net">w3m</a>, and settled on the third one. Lynx feels the simplest one of the three. It would be fine but pages took ages to load for some reason. ELinks is really nice and full featured but didn’t worked well with suspending to background and resuming (Ctrl-Z and <code>fg</code> respectively). The program froze after resuming (if any other command was run after suspending it) which breaks my command line workflow. w3m works great for me: loads pages really fast, works seamlessly with backgrounding/foregrounding, even has support for multiple tabs and bookmarks. It is not the most user friendly program but I’ll get used to it.</p>
<h3 id="text-editor-vim">Text editor: Vim</h3>
<p>Vim is my text editor of choice. While installation itself is dead simple, there’re few caveats. To use Vim in all the places where text editor is needed set <code>VISUAL</code> and <code>EDITOR</code> <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Guide_to_Unix/Environment_Variables">environment variables</a> (e.g. <code>export VISUAL=/usr/bin/vim</code> in <code>~/.bashrc</code>). There’re also special cases as well. <code>visudo</code> doesn’t use the environment variables to determine text editor by default out of security concerns. Add <code>Defaults editor=/usr/bin/vim</code> to <code>sudoers</code> file to use Vim. w3m uses an external editor for text field input. To make it pick up <code>EDITOR</code> environment variable you’ll need to go to its configuration by pressing <code>o</code> and clear <code>Editor</code> configuration field. Now it should be safe to remove <code>vi</code> package.</p>
<h3 id="terminal-multiplexer-gnu-screen">Terminal multiplexer: GNU screen</h3>
<p>To be able to quickly switch between w3m, Vim and shell I use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">GNU screen</a>. I had two issues with screen: default command prefix Ctrl-A is clashing with the bash movement to get to the beginning of the line and screen is flashing in place where you’d usually hear bell sound in a graphical terminal emulator (e.g, backspacing en empty line). The fixes are accordingly <code>escape ^Jj</code> (changes command prefix to Ctrl-J) and <code>vbell off</code> in <code>~/.screenrc</code>. Because of the way console auto login is set up it’s not possible to lock tty1 by exiting it. GNU screen’s lock can be used instead (x in the default keybinding). In the future I’d like to try tmux instead of screen but I’m not up for learning and configuring it now.</p>
<p>Using multiple virtual terminals is a simple alternative option to a terminal multiplexer. To switch between terminals use <code>Alt</code> + right/left arrow. To scroll back Shift-PageDown/Shift-PageUp (see <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Scrollback_buffer#Scrollback">here</a> for more details). Even if you do use a terminal multiplexer there’re boot messages in console (printed before screen for example is launched) you might want to scroll back and read. To not lose any boot messages I’ve added <code>fbcon=scrollback:512k</code> to the kernel boot options in <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-boot#Configuration">systemd-boot entry configuration</a> which expands virtual terminal buffer.</p>
<p>Hint: if your virtual terminal appears to be stuck, it might be that you unintentionally paused console output by <code>Ctrl-S</code>, to resume use <code>Ctrl-Q</code>.</p>
<h3 id="version-control-git-and-ssh">Version control: Git and SSH</h3>
<p>To get access to source of my blog on GitHub and to be able to publish updates I need Git. There’re no issues to obtain Git itself using pacman. I use SSH keys to authorize access to my GitHub account without entering password every time. To get it working an SSH client is needed and a key needs to be generated (I usually don’t reuse SSH keys across environments) and added to GitHub. To get an SSH client I have installed <code>openssh</code> package. See <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Generating-Your-SSH-Public-Key">Git documentation</a> and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh">GitHub guide</a> how to generate an SSH key and add it to GitHub.</p>
<h3 id="gpg">GPG</h3>
<p>I use <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GPG">GPG</a> to <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work">sign my Git commits</a> which is already installed as part of <code>base</code> package group. There’re a few caveats to consider however. By default GPG uses a graphical password prompt provided by <code>pinentry</code> program, see <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GPG#pinentry">here</a> how to change it curses-based version that works in console. It is also required to set <code>GPG_TTY</code> environment variable to <code>$(tty)</code> for <code>pinentry-curses</code> to work properly. You might need to <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GPG#Reload_the_agent">restart GPG agent</a> for the changes to have effect. See <a href="https://gist.github.com/chrisroos/1205934">this gist</a> (Method 2) on instructions how to move the GPG keys to your new environment. If you want to wipe the USB stick used to copy the key it can be done using <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Securely_wipe_disk#shred"><code>shred</code> command</a>.</p>
<h3 id="static-blog-generator-hakyll">Static blog generator: Hakyll</h3>
<p>To build my Hakyll blog generator all I needed were <code>ghc</code> and <code>stack</code> packages. No additional configuration were needed. All of the post above was already written under Arch Linux in virtual console.</p>
<h2 id="fix-meta-key-workman-keyboard-layout-specific">Fix Meta key (Workman keyboard layout specific)</h2>
<p>I rely heavily on bash movement commands. E.g. M-b/M-f to move by words backward and forward. “M-” prefix stands for “Meta” which corresponds to Alt on contemporary keyboards (same as Option on Apple’s keyboard). In terminals Meta modifier is usually sent as Escape preceding a letter. Because of this fact it makes no difference in terminal to press Alt-b or Escape followed by b. For some reason bash movements worked properly with Escape key, but not with Alt keys. First I suspected that Alt was not configured properly to send escape prefix. <code>setmetamode</code> command revealed that Meta is in escape prefix mode. Than I noticed that Meta-b behaves exactly as Meta-t and Meta-f like Meta-u. In Workman layout key t is mapped to letter b, the same for u and f. Given the fact I concluded that something is wrong with my Workman keymap. Indeed Alt modifiers weren’t mapped properly and used definitions from QWERTY layout. It was quite hard to find proper documentation about kbd keymaps online. <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Extra_keyboard_keys">ArchWiki article</a> is a pretty good overview and all the details are available in keymaps man page which is written very thoroughly. You can find <a href="https://github.com/raindev/workman/commit/03bc14706070cc3d93066a86e8ce8b5e9eb24525">the patch</a> fixing Meta characters on my GitHub.</p>
<h2 id="disable-macbook-startup-sound">Disable MacBook startup sound</h2>
<p>OS X stores audio volume level in an EFI variable that is used during early boot to produce appropriately loud annoying sound. EFI variables are already mounted as files under <code>/sys/firmware/efi/efivars/</code>. To disable startup sound from Linux you’ll need to set the volume to zero. See ArchWiki <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MacBook#Mute_startup_chime">instructions</a>. For safety reason most of the variables are immutable. To be able to rewrite the volume do <code>chattr -i /sys/firmware/efi/efivars/SystemAudioVolume-7c436110-ab2a-4bbb-a880-fe41995c9f82</code> as <code>root</code>. You can install <code>efivar</code> to check the value of the EFI variable. It won’t harm to change the modified variable back to immutable (<code>chattr +i</code>).</p>
<h2 id="suspend-issues">Suspend issues</h2>
<p>While closing lid to suspend worked well out of box, with <code>systemctl suspend</code> the laptop was brought to sleep only for a few seconds and than waked up. This is not new problem, I’ve found a solution on <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Mac#Suspend_and_Hibernate">ArchWiki</a>. <code>cat /proc/acpi/wakeup</code> will give you a list of devices allowed to wake up the machine. To prevent a device from waking up the system write a device name from the first column to the file (e.g. <code>echo LID0 | tee /proc/acpi/wakeup</code> for lid). In my case it was the lid and not a USB controller as mentioned on the wiki causing issues. I haven’t figured a way to create an <code>udev</code> rule for the laptop lid so I created a simple systemd unit to disable it during startup (see <a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/47695/how-to-write-startup-script-for-systemd/47715#47715">this StackOverflow answer</a>).</p>
<p>The drawback is that closing lid to suspend will no longer work. If you want to use both lid and <code>systemd</code> to suspend, see <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1556046#p1556046">this Arch Linux Forum post</a> to toggle LID wakeup on the fly only for suspend (I haven’t tried it). To mitigate the problem I’ve assigned my power button to suspend laptop instead of shutting it down, instructions are available <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Power_management#ACPI_events">here</a>. Bonus point is that I won’t unintentionally halt the laptop by hitting the power button accidentally.</p>
<h2 id="network-autoconfiguration">Network autoconfiguration</h2>
<p>I have noticed (using <code>juornalctl -p3 -b</code>) that there’s a timeout error when trying to start Ethernet adapter device (<code>sys-subsystem-net-devices-enp0s20u1.device</code>). Using <code>systemctl list-dependencies --reverse sys-subsystem-net-devices-enp0s20u1.device</code> I have figured out that it’s <code>dhcpcd</code> triggering initialization of the missing device. It kind of makes sense as I do not have it plugged in when working of the battery and have <code>dhcpcd@enp0s20u1.service</code> enabled (see <a href="/build-yourself-arch-linux-1.html#installing-and-configuring-base-system">first part of the guide</a>). At first I have added a condition <code>ConditionPathExists=/sys/class/net/%i</code> to <code>dhcpcd</code> systemd unit file (<code>/usr/lib/systemd/system/dhcpcd@.service</code>) to only start it if the network device is present. Later on I have decided that I don’t want network connection to be established until started explicitly and disabled the <code>dhcpcd</code> service. The changes done to the dhcpcd systemd unit in the first part of the tutorial can also be reverted (by reinstalling the package, e.g.).</p>
<h2 id="backup">Backup</h2>
<p>Following <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/System_maintenance#Backup">the Arch Wiki recommendations</a> I have set up a basic backup to a USB flash stick. Backup includes a few top level directories (<code>/boot</code>, <code>/etc</code>, <code>/home</code>, <code>/data</code>, <code>/usr/local</code>, <code>/var</code>) copied over using <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Rsync#As_a_cp_alternative"><code>rsync</code></a>, lists of native and foreign (coming from outside of Arch Linux core package repositories, e.g. from AUR) pacman packages and LUKS-encrypted partition header. There’s still plenty of room for improvements in my backup scheme: encryption, more granular or more complete file backup, backup to multiple places (now I can loose a backpack with both my laptop and the backup USB stick), backup scheduling, automated restore to name a few.</p>
<p>To ease mounting of the backup USB stick I’ve added the following line to <code>/etc/fstab</code>:</p>
<p><code>UUID=8e713409-6935-4206-9476-067df8dee417	/mnt/aquamarine	ext4	user,rw,noauto,nodev,nosuid,noexec	0	0</code></p>
<p><code>user</code> option gives not root user permissions to mount the file system (see <code>man 8 mount</code>). <code>nodev,nosuid,noexec</code> described below in <a href="#security">the security section</a>. <code>noauto</code> disables automatic mounting. Now <code>mount /mnt/aquamarine</code> doesn’t require privileges escalation.</p>
<h2 id="package-management">Package management</h2>
<h3 id="pacman-mirrors">pacman mirrors</h3>
<p>See <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Mirrors#List_by_speed">instructions</a> how to rank pacman repository mirrors by speed. After obtaining list of fastest mirrors I’ve excluded all the mirrors that are not 100% synced accordingly to the <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/mirrors/status/">Mirror Status</a> page. Also I have removed all the http sources. I have no doubts about Arch <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman/Package_signing">package signing practices</a> but I don’t like leaking my package usage habit in plain text. It might make an intruder’s job easier if he will know exactly what versions of what software am I running and when do I update it.</p>
<h3 id="pacman-cleanup">pacman cleanup</h3>
<p>While I was experimenting with different packages some of transitive dependencies might be left behind. Fortunately, pacman remembers the reason for package installation. To query all the packages installed previously as dependencies do <code>pacman -Qdt</code>.</p>
<p>By default pacman will keep all the packages that were installed at some point of time. It makes sense to clean them up sometimes. There’s a handy script for exactly this task called <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman#Cleaning_the_package_cache"><code>paccache</code></a>. I’m not low on disk by any means, it doesn’t make sense for me to clean the cache aggressively. It’s there for a reason after all (e.g. I may need to downgrade a package which is much easier having it in the cache). It’s possible to clean up only uninstalled packages, that’s what I did. The trick is you’ll have to tell <code>paccache</code> to keep 0 versions of package (see <code>-h</code> on details) otherwise it will not remove all the uninstalled package versions.</p>
<h2 id="security">Security</h2>
<p>Following <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Security#Mount_options">security recommendations</a> I have added <code>nodev</code> and <code>nosuid</code> mount options to <code>/etc/fstab</code> for <code>/var</code>, <code>/home</code>, <code>/data</code> and <code>/boot</code>. The idea is that those file systems have not a need to expose physical devices (<code>nodev</code>) nor to escalate permissions to the binary owner/group in case <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid"><code>suid</code></a> flag is set (<code>nosuid</code>). Usually those capabilities needed only for root file system. For <code>/data</code> and <code>/boot</code> I have also set <code>noexec</code> which disables binary execution from those partitions as these are not intended to store any programs.</p>
<p>To make files readable/writable/executable only for author user by default I have replaced <code>umask 022</code> with <code>umask 077</code> in <code>/etc/profile</code>. The former gave read access by default to the user’s group and other users which is not really necessary. After or week or so abandoned this idea as it resulted in more commands requiring root to execute which is an unpleasant security implications (probably outweighing the benefits).</p>
<p>Because running an advanced text editor (e.g. vim) as <code>root</code> is is equivalent running a shell as root which ought to be avoided when possible. To mitigate the problem <code>sudoedit</code> command exists which will copy over the file after editing it as an unprivileged user. <code>sudoedit</code> will use editor configuration from <code>/etc/sudoers</code> so we’re all set.</p>
<h3 id="dnssec">DNSSEC</h3>
<p>DNSSEC to DNS is (roughly) what HTTPS (SSL) is to HTTP. Both SSL and DNSSEC will ensure authenticity of the received information from a web server and a DNS server respectively. The same as with HTTPS, DNS will protect only domains that are explicitly using it. The difference is that DNSSEC is only about verifying and not about encrypting data. There’s really not that many reasons to encrypt DNS traffic as the only sensitive information it contains is names of the resources you connect. This information will be revealed to your ISP anyway when you’ll send a network request to the resource which IP address you’ve identified via DNS. The only solution to keep network resources you connect to private is some sort of VPN.</p>
<p>The problem is, unlike SSL, DNSSEC is not widely supported by networking software so the easiest to employ it is to use a DNS proxy. I’ve chosen to install local <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unbound">Unbound</a> DNS server that supports DNSSEC and also does caching. Unbound is lightweight (it will be running on my laptop) and configuration is very simple. To install Unbound with DNSSEC support you’ll need <code>unboud</code> and <code>expat</code> packages (the second is probably installed already). I’ve stripped down the <code>/etc/unbound/unbound.conf</code> file of configurations set to defaults and made it listen to IPv6 localhost and prefer IPv6 when performing queries (to be ready when IPv6 will take over the world):</p>
<pre><code>server:
  trust-anchor-file: trusted-key.key
  interface: ::1
  prefer-ip6: yes</code></pre>
<p>This is enough to use Unbound but ArchWiki also recommends to update information about the root DNS servers rather than relying on defaults, see <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unbound#Root_hints">here</a>. <code>unbound-checkconf</code> can be used to verify configuration for errors. To run Unbound I’ve just started and enabled <code>unbound</code> systemd service. See <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unbound#DNSSEC_validation">this section</a> to verify that DNSSEC is working.</p>
<p>To use my own DNS resolver it needs to be specified in <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> as <code>nameserver ::1</code> (actually that’s the only required parameter for the file), see <code>man 5 resolv.conf</code>. Some networking software (dhcpcd and netctl, e.g.) might change <code>resolv.con</code> in runtime which is not desirable in my case (related <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Resolv.conf#Preserve_DNS_settings">ArchWiki section</a>. To prevent that from happening I’ve grepped though my netctl profiles (<code>/etc/netcl/</code>) for <code>DNS=</code> to make sure no one is overriding DNS configuration (see <code>man 5 netctl.profile</code>) and added <code>nohook resolv.conf</code> to <code>/etc/dhcpcd.conf</code> (see <code>man 5 dhcpcd.conf</code>). Furthermore, to make sure that the file wouldn’t be modified unintentionally, I’ve made it immutable (<code>chattr +i</code>).</p>
<h3 id="firewall">Firewall</h3>
<p>I have set up firewall manually using <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Iptables">iptables</a>. My configuration is basically a simple stateful firewall as described by <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Simple_stateful_firewall#Firewall_for_a_single_machine">ArchWiki</a> with some minor modifications. I’ve used an example file from <code>/etc/iptables/simple_firewall.rules</code> as a template to configure my firewall.</p>
<p>Default policy for <code>INPUT</code> and <code>FORWARD</code> chains is <code>DROP</code> and <code>ACCEPT</code> for <code>OUTPUT</code>. There’re five custom chains in my configuration: <code>logdrop</code> - logs and drops packets; <code>logrejectproto</code>, <code>logrejectport</code>, <code>logrejectrst</code> - log and reject packets with respectively ICMP protocol and port unreachable and TCP reset; <code>limitlog</code> - will log packets rate limiting it (to 5 packets per second, logging first 5 packets from each burst). All the rules I have are for <code>INPUT</code> chain: accept localhost packages, accept packets from <code>RELATED</code>/<code>ESTABLISHED</code> connections and drop from <code>INVALID</code>, accept ICMP pings. After these rules is the point where I can add rules for opening ports if I’ll need to. Rest of the packets are rejected with appropriate responses by jumping to the custom chains described above: resets for TCP, port unreachable for UDP and protocol unreachable otherwise.</p>
<p>IPv6 firewall rules are mostly the same as IPv4 rules. Modifications include replaced ICMP ping rule with ICMPv6 ping rule, the two ICMP rejects need to be replaced with ICMPv6 <code>icmp6-adm-prohibited</code>. <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Simple_stateful_firewall#IPv6">Arch Linux wiki article</a> also has recommendations how to allow Neighbor Discovery Protocol and other IPv6 peculiarities.</p>
<p>After configuration both <code>iptables</code> and <code>ip6tables</code> systemd services need to be enabled.</p>
<h2 id="utilities">Utilities</h2>
<p>Nothing fancy here, just a few small and useful programs I’ve installed along the way:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tree</code> - draw a tree of files and directories</li>
<li><code>shellcheck</code> - check shell scripts for common pitfalls and mistakes</li>
<li><code>pacutils</code> - provides <code>paccheck</code> utility to see what pacman packages were modified after installation</li>
<li><code>pkgstats</code> - help Arch Linux maintainers by sharing anonymous package usage stats. I had to mask its systemd timer (<code>systemctl mask pkgstats.timer</code> to disable automatic uploads of the reports.</li>
<li><code>wget</code> - command-line file downloader</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rust">Rust</h2>
<p>Pretty much boils down to installing <code>rustup</code> which is available from the official repositories. See <code>rustup -h</code> for details on installing, updating and selecting default Rust toolchain. <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Rust">The wiki page</a> on the subject is pretty extensive and detailed as well.</p>
<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>
<p>I’d like to change GNU screen’s command prefix to Ctrl-I as it is on the home row of Workman layout (unlike Ctrl-J) but for some reason Tab gets intercepted in that case and do not work for bash completion.</p>
<p>To reconnect to different WiFi network <code>wifi-menu</code> should be used. <code>netctl start &lt;profile&gt;</code> fails because interface is already up.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Getting some work done from virtual console is definitely possible and it’s definitely useful to be able to do so. A lot of things work in a different way in the virtual console and you’ll have to adapt (e.g. scrolling back, copying-pasting, working with multiple shells) but it’s not that inconvenient once you’ve learned your way around. I’ll probably use a graphical terminal emulator even for my command line work from now on. Main limitation I’ve run into is unavailability of large bitmap fonts. Even the largest I’ve found so far (Terminus 32) is a bit too small for me. Going further this route I’d probably needed to make my own console fonts. I’ve got an impression that it would be more convenient to work with a virtual console on a desktop because of availability of full size keyboard (scollback e.g. relies on PageUp/PageDown keys) and lower screen pixel density.</p>

<p>After trying almost (hello, org-mode) all digital solutions for organizing my life out there and spending hundreds of dollars and countless hours worth of time I’ve bought myself a paper notebook. And I’m happy that I did. I used to be a firm proponent of keeping one’s life digital as much as possible so it may sound like a strange decision. And indeed it is. Not that I’ve never used a paper notebook before. But it never was front and center of organizing my life.</p>
<p>The notebook never get out of charge, never crashes, I’ll never lose my notes because of a bug in the synchronization. Simple things is what brings happiness.</p>

<h1 id="part-1-base-system">Part 1: Base System</h1>
<p>This is the first part of <a href="/build-yourself-arch-linux-2.html">a series of articles</a> on how I set up dual boot Arch Linux on my Mid 2014 MacBook Pro. At the end of this part I’ll have a bootable but completely minimal installation of Arch on an encrypted partition without any tuning. Ability to boot to Mac OS will be preserved.</p>
<h3 id="updates">Updates</h3>
<p>December 11, 2016: clarify how to customize list of installed base package; add instructions how to start wired network automatically; describe a separate <code>/data</code> partition.</p>
<p>January 8, 2017: provide fix for startup hang caused by dhcpcd systemd service; add mkinitcpio hook for USB keyboard detection; use larger console font.</p>
<p>April 2, 2017: recommend overriding <code>dhcpcd@.service</code> systemd unit settings instead of editing the original file.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>I had the idea of going back to using Linux for some time now. It’s hard for me to pinpoint a specific reasons for that. I’ve got feeling like I’m missing out lots of interesting stuff going on in the Linux world. Like the renaissance of containerisation and virtualization technologies, unikernels. While it’s true that almost all of that is made available for Mac, it oftentimes feels like terrible hacks has been done to make it work. Also, I’m inclined to think that I haven’t learned as much about computers as I could have during my time on OS X. I’m usually hesitant to learn proprietary things, well because of irrelevance of the knowledge outside of a cage. That way, I didn’t get to know OS X itself that well. I have learned the other side of “just works” - the feeling of helplessness when things do not work.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/october-2016/">Latest Apple special event</a> was just enough bullshit I can take. Do whatever you want with your TouchBar and feedbackless keyboard, Apple, but I’m leaving. But I’m not going to throw the computer I’ve spent about $3K on, so here I am, installing Arch Linux on my MacBook.</p>
<p>Given the above arguments one may ask why not just install Ubuntu for example. While Ubuntu is a good system to start with (I’ve used it myself for about two years) I wanted to try something different this time. The primary reason to try Arch Linux is learning. I have learned <em>a lot</em> when installing Arch Linux and writing this tutorial. The other thing is that I enjoy feeling of control over my machine. I like to know exactly what is installed and what is running on my computer, I don’t want to be distracted by the stuff I do not use. Also I like the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_release">rolling release</a>. To be able to run the latest version of packages and the kernel is nice.</p>
<p>While there’s no shortage of tutorials for installing Arch Linux on MacBook, everyone’s case is different, so my experience may be useful to someone. I’m not intend to write an exhaustive tutorial with every command one will need to execute, but rather an outline with links to already existing materials and how my personal setup differs. Please follow an awesome <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide">Installation guide</a> and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MacBook">MacBook article</a> on ArchWiki, think and read (or at least skim through) man pages of unfamiliar commands. I’m not liable for any damage caused by my writings to your computer so be careful. Let’s go.</p>
<h2 id="preparing-the-installation">Preparing the installation</h2>
<p>Before start you’ll need to buy/borrow an Ethernet adapter for you Mac as WiFi probably won’t work out of the box. It is possible to install Arch Linux using WiFi but I decided to skip the hassle. See <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MacBookPro11,x#Wireless">the wiki</a> if you’re interested. Also, I would recommend to use an external display to no be blinded by your laptop’s brightness during the installation. I’m going to keep OS X on my laptop for foreseeable future and dual boot into Arch Linux. If you do not intend to do that some parts of the installation process will be simpler (at least you would not have to worry about wiping the wrong partition).</p>
<p>To keep OS X partition untouched I needed to shrink it to make some space for Linux. I split my 256G storage in half by shrinking the partition using OS X. There’re some hiccups: OS X El Capitan uses Core Storage Volumes by default and they are not easily resizeable. To resize the partition you’ll need <a href="http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/139868/59256">convert it back</a> to “native volume”. Before conversion volume needs to be unencrypted, you’ll have to turn FileVault off and wait a few ours until the disc will be decrypted. After that you can resize the OS X partition (using Disk Utils app or <code>diskutil</code> command) and turn FileVault back on.</p>
<p>First I had to <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/download/">grab an Arch Linux ISO</a> which is around 800 MB. I always forget to verify downloads but it’s better to not skip this step. Read <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Category:Getting_and_installing_Arch">here</a> how to verify the downloaded ISO using GPG. If you have no GPG installed, checksums are better than nothing. The GPG signature and the checksums are available on the download page. Preparing installation USB is dead simple, see <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_flash_installation_media#In_macOS">the instructions</a>. Reboot, hold Alt as soon as you hear startup sound and select your USB stick as a boot device. You’re in Arch Linux installation shell now.</p>
<p>Before proceeding I needed to configure the installation environment a little bit. <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fonts#Console_fonts">Set font</a> to something bigger (12x22) to be able actually see something (I use iso01-12x22). If you like me use something other than standard US layout, you’ll need to <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Set_the_keyboard_layout">change the keymap</a>. Because I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout#Workman">Workman layout</a> I had to download a keymap for it from <a href="https://github.com/ojbucao/Workman">GitHub</a>. If you want to remap Caps Lock to Control immediately, edit your preferred keymap file and set keycode 58 to <code>Control</code> as I did <a href="https://github.com/raindev/workman/blob/61fa62503af4322ab7d0559ced9a6201fbf7cac8/linux_console/workman.iso15.kmap#L62">here</a> for Workman. To download something from GitHub it is possible to use <code>elinks</code> browser from the shell. <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Update_the_system_clock">Adjust the system clock</a> and lets continue onto the next step.</p>
<h2 id="disk-partition">Disk partition</h2>
<p>I want to have full disk encryption enabled for my Linux partitions. To do that I’ve decided to go with LVM on LUKS as one from <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Disk_encryption">available options</a>. It means that there’s a single container encrypted using dm-crypt with LUKS and inside of the container there are multiple logical volumes managed by LVM. dm-crypt is the standard encryption functionality provided by the kernel itself and LUKS is a convenient utility to manage it. LVM is a flexible solution to manage logical partitions independently of the disk layout.</p>
<p>There’s a <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Partitioning">nice article</a> on ArchWiki to help you decide what partition layout you want. I have settled on the following scheme: 20 GB for root partition; 12 GB for <code>/var</code> to prevent bewildered logs from eating up the space; 16 GB for swap partition; 18 GB for <code>/home</code> to store operational data and user configurations; as it is generally not recommended to share <code>/home</code> across OS installations I have created a separate <code>/data</code> partition for longer term storage (~47 GB).</p>
<p>First we would need a partition for our LVM container. Use <code>fdisk -l</code> (or any other <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Partitioning#Partitioning_tools">partition tool</a>) to take a look at what layout you’ve got already. In my case I’m interested in <code>/dev/sda</code> half of it occupied by OS X as <code>/dev/sda1</code> and half of it free. I used <code>gdisk</code> to create a new partition of type <code>8E00</code> (Linux LVM). It was created as <code>/dev/sda2</code>. That’s pretty much all I need from <code>gdisk</code>, all the LVM volumes will be leaving inside of container <code>/dev/sda2</code>. NB: Apple recommends to have 200Mb gap between partitions for possible future use, use <code>+200M</code> as a start sector of your new partition, if you want to. We’re going to leave the existing <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface">UEFI</a> boot partition as is so you would not need to create a new one for <code>/boot</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to be secure, the newly created container partition needs to be <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Drive_preparation#dm-crypt_wipe_on_an_empty_disk_or_partition">securely wiped</a> first. Please, try to not mistype your <em>empty</em> partition number. <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#Preparing_the_disk_2">Here</a> is how to initialize encrypted LUKS container and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#Preparing_the_logical_volumes">slice it into partitions</a>. Skip sections about the boot partition as we have it already. I’ve initialized LUKS with default <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Device_encryption#Encryption_options_for_LUKS_mode">encryption options</a> as they seemed to roughly match what people recommend to use anyway. By this time you should have all the partitions mounted and formatted. Now mount your <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/EFI_System_Partition">ESP</a> to <code>/mnt/boot</code>.</p>
<h2 id="installing-and-configuring-base-system">Installing and configuring base system</h2>
<p>First, check out if <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Select_the_mirrors">list of mirror servers</a> looks sane. The highest priority servers were not from beyond an ocean and packages download speed was pretty high, so I’m fine with the defaults.</p>
<p>Now it’s time to <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Install_the_base_packages">markup the file system of your new OS and install the most necessary packages</a>. If you want to be absolutely minimal and customize list of installed base packages, pass <code>-i</code> option to <code>pacstrap</code> and read <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman#Installing_package_groups">here</a> about syntax used. I do not need <code>nano</code> or <code>mdadm</code> (RAID management tool), for example. To keep my modified version of Workman layout, I copied the <code>.kmap</code> file to <code>/mnt/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/</code>. One more thing to do before you’ll switch into your brand new environment is to <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Fstab">generate fstab</a>.</p>
<p>Behold and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Chroot">enter the brave new world</a>! Configure <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Time_zone">timekeeping</a>, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fonts#Persistent_configuration">font</a>, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Locale">locale and keyboard</a>, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Hostname">hostname</a>. To figure out if your hardware clock is indeed set to UTC compare <code>hwclock --utc</code> and <code>hwclock --localtime</code> (unless you live in UTC :P). While wired network should work out of the box (I’m going to configure WiFi later), it won’t be started automatically. <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Root_password">Set up root password</a>, it will be possible to create non root users later.</p>
<p>I’m not a big fun of tiny fonts, so I installed <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=terminus-font"><code>terminus-font</code></a> and used <code>ter-132n</code> (Terminus ISO8859-1 16x32 normal) for the persistent configuration. It looks much nicer and has much more comfortable to read size than the default 12x22 fonts.</p>
<p>To have network up after boot you’ll need to <code>systemctl enable</code> <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dhcpcd#Running">the DHCP service</a>. It is recommended to enable DHCP for the specific interface. This is good to not turn on Wi-Fi automatically until requested and avoid possible conflicts with network management software. I ran into problems with this approach however: systemd was waiting for dhcpcd to be started for the wired interface for 90 seconds if the cable was unplugged. I found a solution on Arch Linux <a href="https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/49685#comment148057">bug tracker</a>. See the thread for the patch, you can override <code>dhcpcd@.service</code> template settings in <code>/etc/systemd/system/dhcpcd@.service.d/override.conf</code> (more details on overriding systemd units configuration can be found in <code>man systemd.unit</code>).</p>
<h2 id="initramfs">initramfs</h2>
<p>When computer is turned on the first thing that it runs is UEFI firmware. UEFI than launches an UEFI executable, systemd-boot boot manager that we will install later. systemd-boot is called “boot manager” and not “bootloader” because all it can do is to launch another UEFI applications from ESP. In our case it would be the Linux kernel. EFISTUB is a feature of newer kernels that allows it to act as an UEFI executable. Kernel than loads initramfs which is a set of prebuilt hooks to prepare the system to boot. After that actual OS boot starts from an init process, systemd in our case.</p>
<p>If root partition is encrypted so to be able to boot it needs to be decrypted first. To enable that <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#Configuring_mkinitcpio_2">initramfs hooks</a> are required. To use custom console font and keyboard layout to enter encrypted partition password add <code>consolefont</code> and <code>keymap</code> hooks before <code>encryption</code>. I also experienced my DasKeyboard (connected via monitor USB hub) not being recognized sometimes at encryption password input stage. To avoid the problem add <code>keyboard</code> hook as well. After mkinitcpio, the tool used to build initramfs, is reconfigured, initramfs needs to be <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Initramfs">rebuild</a>.</p>
<h2 id="bootloader">Bootloader</h2>
<p><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-boot">systemd-boot</a> is a pretty simple boot manager to set up so I’ll use it to start. Later I’d like to try rEFInd and its <a href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/themes.html">beautiful themes</a>. Installation of systemd-boot comes down to <code>bootctl install</code>. <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-boot#Configuration">Here</a> is how to configure it. <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-boot#Encrypted_Root_Installations">This</a> section on booting from encrypted partition is of particular interest. Notable you’ll need to add only Arch Linux entry by hands, OS X will be detected automatically at boot time based on the information available on ESP.</p>
<p>It is highly recommended to <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Microcode">enable CPU microcode updates</a> to ensure system stability. Don’t forget to update systemd-boot Arch Linux entry. You should be able to verify that you did everything properly by searching for “microcode updated” in system startup log using <code>journalctl</code>.</p>
<p>Now you’re ready to <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Reboot">reboot</a> into your new shiny OS. On startup you should be presented with systemd-boot menu. After selecting Arch Linux and before boot you’ll be presented with the prompt for your encryption password. After that you should see command line login prompt. Use <code>root</code> user for now.</p>
<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>
<p>While most of the things works as expected there’re few hiccups worth mentioning. First I’ve noticed that <code>/var</code> fails to be unmounted on shutdown. It looks like the problem is with the partition being busy because it’s used by systemd to write system shutdown logs. Quick search revealed that I’m not the only one having the problem unmounting separate <code>/var</code> partition and it should be forcibly unmounted by the end of shutdown process anyway. Still I’d like to make the unmounting error go.</p>
<p>Right now I have to type my password twice: once to unlock the encrypted partition and once to log in as a <code>root</code> user. To not have to do it twice I’m probably going to enable automatic login as a non-root user.</p>
<p>Be careful with doing anything while on battery as until suspend will be setup the machine will halt when run out of battery.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>If you will find any problems I’ve failed to mention or any mistakes while following this guide please email me about them and I’ll update the post. I’ll appreciate any suggestions for improvements.</p>
<p>In some time I hope to post the second part of the guide. I’m going to focus on things like user and power management, wireless and continue to build the system upon the base I have.</p>

<h1 id="or-why-im-leaving-googles-services">Or Why I’m Leaving Google’s Services</h1>
<p>Recently there was a lot of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12972554">talk</a> about Google services on Hacker News. Concerns people have about loosing control over their data prompted me to check out how I use Google.</p>
<p>There’re a few reasons to worry: loosing your data, giving to much personal information to one company and having someone (or something) reading (or scanning) your private stuff. While I tried to limit my use of Google’s services in the past and moved off the major ones like Gmail, Calendar, Contacts there’s still a lot of my stuff on Google’s servers. Especially given my switch to Android about half a year ago.</p>
<p>I was frightened a little bit when I realised that all of my photo archive is in Google Photos and I do not have any backups. While I do trust Google to store my data reliably, I do not want to be denied access to my entire photo collection because of conflict of interest with the company (or simply because of a natural disaster). I decided to download my photos using <a href="https://google.com/settings/takeout">Google Takeout</a> to have at least a local copy until I figure out how I’m going to back up my data properly and find another photo storage solution. I’m looking at Dropbox and Flickr now, Flickr should be more convenient, but Dropbox can be more private. Note how a privacy became a relative term nowadays.</p>
<p>I was surprised how much Google knows about me. You’ll be surprised as well after exploring <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/privacy">privacy section</a> of your Google account settings. To name a few things: my apps usage and passwords, voice and web searches, location history and maps searches, YouTube viewing history, fitness data. That’s huge amount of personal information if you think about it. And that’s given I’m a pretty modest user of Google, there’re people keeping literally everything in Google’s services. Lots the stuff I’ve shared with Google is actually because I’ve tried to use my Nexus the Google way from on the beginning. You’d rather not agreed blindly to everything your new Android phone asks you about during setup. Thankfully, it’s possible to turn off most of the tracking but it takes effort.</p>
<p>While reading about privacy in relation to Google’s services I’ve stumbled upon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhotoDNA">PhotoDNA</a>. The technology is used to scan images to detect unlawful activity like child pornography. And this technology (or something similar) is known to be employed by Google. While I’m totally for fight against child pornography, the particular methods used do worry me. Metaphorically speaking, I don’t want to get into troubles because of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_collision">hash collision</a>. There’s always a chance that machine learning used for crime detection will give a false positive result, it will <em>never</em> be 100% accurate. Also, there’re bugs. I don’t want to be part of the game, I don’t want to engage with law enforcements because of a mistake made by an algorithm. I would rather give up some convenience and had my personal data encrypted in the cloud to have it never scanned regardless of intentions. Also with iOS 10 Apple <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/06/15/see-ios-10s-new-photos-app-in-action/">showed</a> that it’s viable to employ machine learning locally (even on a phone) to give conveniences like categorization and face recognition which were usually associated with processing of photos in the cloud.</p>
<p>(Hash is a supposedly unique fixed size value associated with some input. But because there is limited number of fixed size values and unlimited number of inputs, inevitably some different inputs will be associated with the same hashes. That’s called hash collision. The same basic idea applies to PhotoDNA: two different pictures, one ill and one not, will trigger the same result given large number of samples and an imprecise system, which machine learning always is.)</p>
<p>Going forward I’m going to log in into Google account in my browser only when needed to not have myself constantly tracked on the web. Most of the services are perfectly functional without an account, like Translate, Maps, Search (I use it as a fallback for DuckDuckGo), even YouTube, despite completely crappy default recommendations. Also I’m thinking to create a separate accounts for the services I’ll continue to use like Alerts, Webmaster Tools and for my Android phone. Some services I’m going to ditch, like Analytics, Photos and Hangouts. To get my pictures off Google Photos will be the hardest but I’d like to do it.</p>
<p>I’m not agitating you to leave Google services but be aware what information do you give away and remember to keep backups of your data. If the topic is of interest to you I’ll recommend <a href="https://www.philzimmermann.com/EN/essays/WhyIWrotePGP.html">a very good (despite quite old) article</a> about privacy and encryption by the author of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">GPG</a> Philip Zimmermann.</p>

    <title>On Writer's Block</title>

<p>If you’ll have a look on <a href="/archive.html">timeline</a> of this blog of mine it will be obvious that I’m dealing with writer’s block. I always wanted to have <em>real</em> blog, to do <code>git push</code> to publish, to build it <em>from scratch</em> myself. And about 9 month ago I got it. I found <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a> which felt awesome, like assembling a model airplane from parts. I’ve refined it over couple of weeks and got what I wanted to have. The first post event caught some attention as I’ve decided to post it to Reddit. There has been both positive and negative <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/484isa/why_i_use_space_as_my_vim_leader_key/">feedback</a>. But there will <em>always</em> be negative feedback, so it was fine.</p>
<p>But than I stopped. Not that I stopped to write. I still drafted quite a few articles, had a few enlightening ideas of posts. But I never got to publish any of that. So I decided to <em>post</em> about writer’s block as I got to know what it is too well.</p>
<p>How it usually was:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>get excited</li>
<li>type 500-100 words and get my thoughts out</li>
<li>calm down, save the file</li>
<li>whatever, I’ll edit it tomorrow</li>
<li>the life goes on</li>
</ol>
<p>What I decided to do instead it to “get it posted”. To start writing with an intention to post. It doesn’t matter what the post will be about, whatever consumes my mind the most at the moment, get it <em>out</em>.</p>
<p>How I decided to accomplish what I haven’t been able to do? First, I’m already fed up with my inability to post. Motivation is the key and all of that. The fact that most of my friends have empty blogs do not help, I acknowledge. Reduce friction (you probably know that already): I started to edit a post template directly rather than a file somewhere so publish is literally one command. Do it fast: your energy won’t last long. Edit immediately, but not during writing. I never got to edit most of my drafts. Some <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify_germany/playlist/2nKFnGNFvHX9hG5Kv7Bm3G">deep house</a> may help, if that’s your kind of thing. Oh yeah, shutdown your Internet.</p>
<p>Finally, keep it short (one screen with large font). That’s it. I hope you’ll succeed one day as well.</p>
<p>Bonus tip: you can edit posts <em>after</em> you published them :P</p>

    <title>Space Leader</title>

<h1 id="why-i-use-space-as-my-vim-leader-key">Why I use space as my Vim leader key</h1>
<p>One of the best Vim productivity boosts is to configure your leader key. What leader key does - it gives you a namespace for custom mappings. No default Vim mappings use leader key, so you’re free to choose whatever shortcuts you like without worrying about conflicts with some predefined mappings. Considering this it makes sense to define custom mappings using leader key. It also facilitates remembering of shortcuts by providing mental separation for the ones you’ve crafted yourself. To activate a shortcut you just press leader key and than a specific mapping, e.g. I use <code>&lt;leader&gt;w</code> to save current file. Configuring such a mapping is quite easy: add <code>map &lt;leader&gt;w</code> to your .vimrc and you’re done. Noticing things you do repeatedly working day-to-day in Vim and creating custom mappings for them will allow you to save a little bit of time constantly and will make editing with Vim more effortless.</p>
<p>Lots of Vim tutorials recommend to use <code>,</code> as leader key. However I see a few benefits of using spacebar instead.</p>
<h2 id="it-doesnt-override-any-default-vim-mappings">It doesn’t override any default Vim mappings</h2>
<p>Contrary to <code>,</code>, which is used to move cursor to previous occurrence of a character navigated to using <code>t</code> or <code>f</code>, space doesn’t do any particularly useful in normal mode by default. Yes, it does move cursor to the next character, but the motion is already covered by <code>l</code> key anyway (or an arrow key if you like to use those). So we could safely override default space behaviour. <code>,</code> is quite important for my workflow on the opposite side.</p>
<h2 id="space-is-easy-to-reach-to">Space is easy to reach to</h2>
<p>Most of your custom mappings will use leader key, so it should be better easy to type. Spacebar is a huge key placed very conveniently on most keyboards. It’s a safe bet regarding ergonomics.</p>
<h2 id="space-is-symmetrical">Space is symmetrical</h2>
<p>This one alone is a good reason for me to use spacebar as my leader key. Given it’s <em>equally</em> easily reachable for <em>both hands</em>, space leaves me with all the alphanumeric keys as convenient shortcut options. Again in contrast to <code>,</code> which is typed by the right hand making left hand letters more comfortable options for typing shortcuts without stretching fingers.</p>
<p>There’s even a text editor (a flavour of Emacs) based around the idea of space key as a gateway to all the editor commands called <a href="http://spacemacs.org">Spacemacs</a>. I’ve been playing around with it a little bit recently and it has been positive experience so far. Spacemacs goes one step further by providing instant visual feedback about available commands once you’ve pressed space key.</p>
<h2 id="think-for-yourself">Think for yourself</h2>
<p>This way to use leader key fits <em>my</em> workflow very well. It may or may not be as efficient in your case. Be critical of that “mappings every Vimmer should use” tips (and of this article as well). Try what works best for <em>you</em>, your fingers and your keyboard. If you’re interested more in how I use Vim check out my <a href="https://github.com/raindev/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> GitHub repo. Happy editing!</p>
