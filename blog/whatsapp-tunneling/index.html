<p>A colleague asked me on Twitter what the problems do I have with the way WhatsApp tunnels all the messages though my phone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/raindev_/status/859872365886545920">@raindev_</a>: I'm
tired of WhatsApp tunneling all the messages through my phone. Time to
look for an alternative?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JensRantil/status/861205974933270528">@JensRantil</a>:
Also, what part about the tunneling do you find annoying? Very rarely
don't I have my phone on same Wi-Fi as computer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer turned out to be too long for Twitter so I decided to write a short post.</p>
<p>Just to clarify: it's not required for the phone to be on the same Wi-Fi network, being connected to the Internet is enough.</p>
<p>While that's true that most of the time my phone is connected, I have a few issue with this approach.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I doesn't work truly reliably. Sometimes I need to wake up my phone to connect/reconnect to WhatsApp from the desktop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It drains phone battery unnecessarily. Especially if I'm connected to WhatsApp the whole day, e.g. at an office. While the impact may not be huge really, I don't see a reason to sacrifice part of already scarce phone battery life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My phone isn't really <em>always</em> connected. I don't want to fall offline if I forgot a charger/to charge/or my phone altogether. Made worse by the fact that I need to scan a barcode from the phone to connect which is awkward to do remotely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because all the messages have to be tunneled though my specific device, I can't use WhatsApp on two different phones at the same time. Yes, I do use two phones regularly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If phone is offline, there's no access to old messages as all of them are stored on the phone only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, while not directly caused by the tunneling, but tied together with the decision to do authentication by phone number: impossible to log out a device remotely, I'd better not loose my phone; lack of iPad app, is probably a result of the same decision line.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While  all of the issues above are not critical (in fact I've used WhatsApp as my main messenger successfully for more than a year), they makes me look at alternatives time to time (the current contender is <a href="https://wire.com">Wire</a>).</p>
