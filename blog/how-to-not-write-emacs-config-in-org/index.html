<p>I have started simple. <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code> had just one line:</p>
<pre><code>(org-babel-load-file &quot;~/.emacs.d/init.org&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p><code>init.org</code> was simple too:</p>
<pre><code>#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-directory &quot;~/org&quot;)
#+end_src
</code></pre>
<p>After restarting Emacs everything seems to have worked fine <code>C-h v</code>
told me that the value of <code>org-directory</code> is indeed <code>~/org</code>.  So far
so good.  I have opened <code>init.el</code> and its content was:</p>
<pre><code>(setq org-directory &quot;~/org&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>That's right, the same as the code I had in the source block in
<code>init.org</code>.  Clumsy Emacs beginner, I thought, I must have written the
wrong file!  I have fixed it quickly to put <code>org-babel-load-file</code> in
the right place and restarted Emacs.  Right after start <code>*Warnings*</code>
buffer popped up and showed me this error:</p>
<pre><code>error: Recursive load, /home/raindev/.emacs.d/init.el, /home/raindev/.emacs.d/init.el, /home/raindev/.emacs.d/init.el, /home/raindev/.emacs.d/init.el, /home/raindev/.emacs.d/init.el
</code></pre>
<p>Whoa!  My first line of configuration and somehow I broke Emacs
already and made it load the config again and again.  I searched the
Internet for the error message in vain, in frustration went to #emacs
and cried for help.  I've been told that it looks like
<code>org-babel-load-file</code> needs something that hasn't been initialized yet
causing Emacs to attempt to load the config again.  It makes sense, I
thought.  With some guidance (thanks pjb!) I made Emacs load the .org
file 5 seconds later when init.el has already been processed:</p>
<pre><code>(defun load-org-config ()
  (org-babel-load-file &quot;~/.emacs.d/init.org&quot;))

(run-at-time 5 1 'load-org-config)
</code></pre>
<p>Once again, I restarted Emacs.  This time, no error messages on
startup. When I switched to <code>*Messages*</code> however, I saw an endless
stream of:</p>
<pre><code>Loading /home/raindev/.emacs.d/init.el (source)...done
Loaded ~/.emacs.d/init.el
Loading /home/raindev/.emacs.d/init.el (source)...done
Loaded ~/.emacs.d/init.el
Loading /home/raindev/.emacs.d/init.el (source)...done
Loaded ~/.emacs.d/init.el
...
</code></pre>
<p>Hm, this is interesting, I thought.  The problem happened <em>after</em>
Emacs was fully initialized as well.  I killed unresponsive Emacs and
started it without loading the config using <code>emacs -q</code>. I hit <code>M-x</code>
and used <code>eval-expression</code> to run <code>(org-babel-load-file &quot;~/.emacs.d/init.org&quot;)</code>.  Not surprisingly, the same thing happened:
Emacs started reloading the config endlessly.</p>
<p>In despair, the next time I loaded just a random <code>projects.org</code> file
that didn't have any configuration or any source code whatsoever.  I've
got an error.  But also something magical happened - a debugger popped
up!</p>
<p><img src="https://raindev.io/blog/how-to-not-write-emacs-config-in-org/emacs-org-babel-load-file-debugger.png" alt="img" /></p>
<p>I could see the chain of function calls that led to the error.  Even
more I could click on them and see the source code.  Wow! This is
amazing!  I had the source code of Emacs' packages right in front of
me.</p>
<p>I started exploring.  The error message was:</p>
<pre><code>(file-missing &quot;Cannot open load file&quot; &quot;No such file or directory&quot; &quot;/home/raindev/org/projects.el&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>That's strange, I thought.  I have loaded <code>projects.org</code> and not
<code>projects.el</code>.  Something is going on.  Looking at the backtrace I
could see <code>org-babel-load-file(&quot;~/org/projects.org&quot;)</code> - that's the
function I have called.  The next call was
<code>load-file(&quot;~/org/projects.el&quot;)</code> - .org has changed to .el.  Something
must have happened during the previous step.  I clicked on
<code>org-babel-load-file</code> and started reading the code:</p>
<pre><code>This function exports the source code using `org-babel-tangle'
and then loads the resulting file using `load-file'
</code></pre>
<p>And that's what happened a couple of lines below:</p>
<pre><code>(let* ((tangled-file (concat (file-name-sans-extension file) &quot;.el&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>So, the function exports the source code to a file with the same name
but .el extension.  Ah!  As there was no code in <code>projects.org</code>
nothing was exported leading to <code>file-missing</code> error.</p>
<p>Going back to the original problem with the new knowledge: why wasn't
<code>init.el</code> replaced by the code from <code>init.org</code> then?  Oh, wait, wasn't
it?  Remember the first time I loaded the Org config, I discovered
I've accidentally written the config to <code>init.el</code> directly.  I didn't!</p>
<pre><code>;; Tangle only if the Org file is newer than the Elisp file
</code></pre>
<p><code>org-babel-load-file</code> did.  As the comment says, the function only
writes .el file if the .org file is newer.  That's what happened the
first time.  Afterwards I kept tweaking <code>init.el</code> so it was always
newer than <code>init.org</code>.  But what else, when <code>org-babel-load-file</code> was
executed Emacs thought <code>init.el</code> is the file that has the code
exported from <code>init.org</code> and loaded it.  In turn it has called the
same function and entered the endless cycle.</p>
<p><img src="https://raindev.io/blog/how-to-not-write-emacs-config-in-org/emacs-org-recursive-reloading.jpg" alt="img" /></p>
<p>The solution was simple - give the Org config a different name:</p>
<pre><code>(org-babel-load-file &quot;~/.emacs.d/config.org&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>And that's it.  <code>config.org</code> will get exported to <code>config.el</code> and
loaded once.</p>
