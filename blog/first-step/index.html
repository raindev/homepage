<p>I'll be upfront: the only reason for this post is to resume this blog. It's been almost two years since I have published the last article. And it's not for the lack of things to write about. I had too many ideas over this time. Not for the lack of effort either: there are a few drafts that never made it live. I can ponder about reasons why this has happened but it doesn't really matter. It you want to achieve something, you got to take the first step. It doesn't have to be perfect and you cannot wait for the ideal moment. The life is too short for that. Now go and take <em>your</em> first step.</p>
