# Build Yourself Arch Linux, Part 1

This is the first part of (hopefully) series of articles on how I set up dual boot Arch Linux on my MacBook Pro Mid 2014. At the end of this part I'll have a bootable but completely minimal installation of Arch on encrypted partition without any tunning and ability to boot to Mac OS preserved.

## Why?

I had the idea of going back to using Linux for some time now. It's hard for me to pinpoint a specific reasons for that. I've got feeling like I'm missing out lots of interesting stuff going on in Linux world. Like renessanse of containerisation and virtualization technologies, unikernels. While it's true that almost all of that is made available for Mac, it oftentime feels like terrible hacks has been done to make it work. Also, I'm inclined to think that I haven't learned as much about computers as I could have during my time on OS X. I'm usually hesistant to learn proprietary thigss, well because of irrelevance of the knowledge outside of a cage. That way, I didn't get to know OS X itself that well. I have learned the other side of things that "just works" that is feeling of heplesness when things do not work.

[Latest Apple special event](http://www.apple.com/apple-events/october-2016/) was just enough bullshit I can take. Do whatever you want with your TouchBar and feedbackless keyboard, Apple, but I'm leaving. But I'm not going to throw the computer I've spent more than $2K on, so here I am, installing Arch Linux on top of the line MacBook Pro Mid 2014.

While there's no shortage of tutorials for installing Arch Linux on MacBook, everyone's case is different, so my experience may be useful to someone. I'm not intend to write an exhaustive tutorial with every command one'll need to execute, but rather outline and how my personal setup differs and link to already existing materials. Please follow an awesome [Installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide) and [MacBook article](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MacBook) on ArchWiki, think and read (or at least skim through) man pages of unfamiliar commands. I'm not liable for any damage caused by my writings to yuor computer so be careful. Let's go.

## Preparing the installation

Before you start you'll need to buy/borrow Ethernet adapter for you Mac as wifi probably won't work out of the box. It is possible to install Arch Linux using wifi but I decided to skip the hassle. See [the wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MacBookPro11,x#Wireless) if you're iterested. I'm going to keep OS X on my laptop for foreseeable future and dual boot Arch Linux. If you do not intend to do that some parts of the installation process will be simpler.

To keep OS X partition untouched I'll need to shrink it to make some space for Linux. I have decided to split my 256G storage in half. I shrinked the partition using OS X. There're some hiccups: OS X El Capitan uses Core Storage Volumens by default and they are not easily resizeable. To resize it you'll need [convert it back](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/139868/59256) to "native volume". Before conversion volume needs to be unencrypted, you'll have to turn FileVault off and wait a few ours until disc will be deencrypted. Now resize the OS X partition (using Disk Utils app or `diskutil` command) and turn FileVault back on.

First I had to [grab an Arch Linux ISO](https://www.archlinux.org/download/) which is around 800Mb. I always forget to verify downloads but it's better to not skip this step. Read [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Category:Getting_and_installing_Arch) how to verify the downloaded ISO using GPG. When I go into hassle of verifying a download I'd like to do it properly, but if you have no GPG installed, hashsums are better than nothing. The GPG signature and the checksums are availabe on the download page. Preparing installation USB is dead simple, see [the instructions](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_flash_installation_media#In_macOS). Reboot, hold Alt as soon as you hear startup sound and select your USB stick as a boot device. You're in Arch Linux installation shell now.

Before proceeding I needed to configure the installation environment a little bit. [Set font](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fonts#Console_fonts) to something bigger (12x22) to be able actually see something (I use iso01-12x22). If you like me use something other than standard US layout, you'll need to [change the keymap](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Set_the_keyboard_layout). Because I use Workman I had to download a keymap for it from [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout#Workman). And if you want to remap Caps Lock to Control immediately, edit your preferred keymap file and set keycode 58 to `Control` as I did [here](https://github.com/raindev/workman/blob/61fa62503af4322ab7d0559ced9a6201fbf7cac8/linux_console/workman.iso15.kmap#L62) for Workman. To download something from GitHub it is possible to use `elinks` browser from the shell. [Adjust the system clock](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Update_the_system_clock) and lets continue onto the next step.

## Partitioning

I want to have full disk encryption enabled for my Linux partitions. To do that I've decided to go with LVM on LUKS as one from [available options](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Disk_encryption). What is means is there's a single container encrypted using dm-crypt with LUKS in which there are multiple logical lolumes managed by LVM. dm-crypt is the standard encryption functionality provided by the kernel itself and LUKS is convenient utility to manage it. LVM is a flexible solution to manage logical partitions independently of the disk layout. There's a [nice article](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Partitioning) on ArchWiki to help you decide what partition layout you want.

First we would need a partition for our LVM container. Use `fdisk -l` (or any other [partition tool](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Partitioning#Partitioning_tools)) to take a look at what layout you've got. In my case I'm interested in `/dev/sda` half of it ocupied by OS X as `/dev/sda1` and half of it free. I used `gdisk` to create a new partition of type `8E00` (Linux LVM). It was created as `/dev/sda2`. Thats pretty much all I need from `gdisk`, all the other Linux partitions will be leaving inside of container `/dev/sda2`. NB: Apple recommends to have 200Mb gap between partitions for possible future use, use `+200M` as a start sector of your new partition. We're going to left [UEFI](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface) boot partition as it so you would not need to create a new one for `/boot`.

If you want to be truly secure, the newly created container partition needs to be [securely wiped](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Drive_preparation#dm-crypt_wipe_on_an_empty_disk_or_partition) first. Please, trty to not mistype your _empty_ partition number. [Here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#Preparing_the_disk_2) is how to initialize encrypted LUKS container and [slice it into partititions](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#Preparing_the_logical_volumes). Skip sections about the boot partition as we have it already. I've initialized LUKS with default [encryption options](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Device_encryption#Encryption_options_for_LUKS_mode) as they seemed to roughtly match what people recommend to use anyway. By this time you should have all the partitions formatted and mounted. Now mount your [ESP](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/EFI_System_Partition) to `/mnt/boot`.

## Installing and configuring base system

First, check out if [list of mirror servers](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Select_the_mirrors) looks sane. The highest priority servers were not from beyond the ocean and package download speed was pretty high, so I'm fine with the defaults.

Now it's time to [markup the filesystem of your new OS and install the most necessary packages](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Install_the_base_packages). Read [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman#Installing_package_groups) if how to customize list of packages to be installed if you want to be absolutely minimal. I do not need nano, for example. To keep my modified version of workman layout, I copied the `.kmap` file to `/mnt/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/`. One more thing to do before you'll switch into your brand new environment is to [generate fstab](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Fstab).

Behold and [enter the new world](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Chroot)! Configure [timekeeping](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Time_zone), [font](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fonts#Persistent_configuration), [locale and keyboard](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Locale), [hostname](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Hostname). To figure out if your hardware clock is indeed set to UTC compare `hwclock --utc` and `hwclock --localtime` (unless you live in UTC :P). Wired network should work out of the box, I'm going to configure wifi later. [Set up root password](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Root_password), it will be possible to create non root users later.

## initramfs

When computer is turned on the first thing that it runs is UEFI firmware. UEFI than launches an UEFI executable, systemd-boot boot manager that we will install later. systemd-boot is called "boot manager" and not "bootloader" because all it can do is to launch another UEFI applications from ESP. In our case it would be the Linux kernel. EFISTUB is a feature of newer kernels that allows it to act as an UEFI executable. Kernel than loads initramfs which is a set of prebuild hooks to prepare the system to boot. After that actual OS boot starts from some init process, systemd in our case.

Now my root partition is encrypted so to be able to boot it needs to be deencrypted first. To enable that [initramfs hooks](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#Configuring_mkinitcpio_2) are required. To use custom console font and keyboard layout to enter encrypted partition password add `consolefont` and `keymap` hooks before `encryption`. After mkinitcpio, the tool used to build initramfs, is reconfigured, initramfs needs to be [rebuild](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Initramfs).

## Bootloader

[systemd-boot](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-boot) is a pretty simple bootl manager to set up so I'll use it to start. Later I'd like to try rEFInd and its [beautiful themes](http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/themes.html). Basically installation of systemd-boot comes to `bootctl install`. [Here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-boot#Configuration) is how to configure it. [This](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-boot#Encrypted_Root_Installations) section on booting from encrypted partion is of particular interest. Notable you'll need to add only Arch Linux entry by hands, OS X will be detected automatically at boot time based on information available on ESP.

It is hightly recommended to [enable CPU microcode updates](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Microcode) to ensure system stability. Don't forget to update systemd-boot Arch Linux entry. You should be able to verify that you did everything properly by searching for "microcode updated" in system startup log using `journalctl`.

Now you're ready to [reboot](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Reboot) into your new shiny OS. On startup you should be presented with systemd-boot menu. After selecting Arch Linux and _before_ boot you'll be presented with prompt for your encryption password. After that you should see command line login prompt. Use `root` user for now.

## Caveats



## Closing thoughts

If you will find any problems I've failed to mention or any mistakes while following this guide please email me about them and I'll update the post. I'll appreciate any suggestions for improvements.

In about a week or two I hope to post the second part of the guide. I'm going to focus on things like user and power management and continue bu build the system upon the base I have.
