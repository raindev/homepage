After trying almost (hello, org-mode) all digital solutions for organizing my life out there and spending hundreds of dollars and countless hours worth of time I've bought myself a paper notebook. And I'm happy that I did. I used to be a firm proponent of keeping one's life digital as much as possible so it may sound like  a strange decision. And indeed it is. Not that I've never used a paper notebook before. But it never was front and center of organizing my life.

The notebook never get out of charge, never crashes, I'll never lose my notes because of a bug in the synchronization. Simple things is what brings happiness.
