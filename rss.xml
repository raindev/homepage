    <title>On Writer's Block</title>
    <link>http://raindev.io/writers-block.html</link>

<p>If you’ll have a look on <a href="/archive.html">timeline</a> of this blog of mine it will be obvious that I’m dealing with writer’s block. I always wanted to have <em>real</em> blog, to do <code>git push</code> to publish, to build it <em>from scratch</em> myself. And about 9 month ago I got it. I found <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a> which felt awesome, like assembling a model airplane from parts. I’ve refined it over couple of weeks and got what I wanted to have. The first post event caught some attention as I’ve decided to post it to Reddit. There has been both positive and negative <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/484isa/why_i_use_space_as_my_vim_leader_key/">feedback</a>. But there will <em>always</em> be negative feedback, so it was fine.</p>
<p>But than I stopped. Not that I stopped to write. I still drafted quite a few articles, had a few enlightening ideas of posts. But I never got to publish any of that. So, I decided, fuck it, I’ll <em>post</em> about writer’s block as I got to know what it is too well.</p>
<p>How it usually was:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>get excited</li>
<li>type 500-100 words and get my thoughts out</li>
<li>calm down, save the file</li>
<li>whatever, I’ll edit it tomorrow</li>
<li>the life goes on</li>
</ol>
<p>What I decided to do instead it to “get it posted”. To start writing with an intention to post. It doesn’t matter what the post will be about, whatever consumes my mind the most at the moment, get it <em>out</em>.</p>
<p>How I decided to accomplish what I haven’t been able to do? First, I’m already fed up with my inability to post. Motivation is the key and all of that. The fact that most of my friends have empty blogs do not help, I acknowledge. Reduce friction (you probably know that already): I started to edit a post template directly rather than a file somewhere so publish is literally one command. Do it fast: your energy won’t last long. Edit immediately, but not during writing. I never got to edit most of my drafts. Some <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify_germany/playlist/2nKFnGNFvHX9hG5Kv7Bm3G">deep house</a> may help, if that’s your kind of thing. Oh yeah, shutdown your Internet.</p>
<p>Finally, keep it short (one screen with large font). That’s it. I hope you’ll succeed one day as well.</p>
<p>Bonus tip: you can edit posts <em>after</em> you published them :P</p>

    <title>Space Leader</title>

<h1 id="why-i-use-space-as-my-vim-leader-key">Why I use space as my Vim leader key</h1>
<p>One of the best Vim productivity boosts is to configure your leader key. What leader key does - it gives you a namespace for custom mappings. No default Vim mappings use leader key, so you’re free to choose whatever shortcuts you like without worrying about conflicts with some predefined mappings. Considering this it makes sense to define custom mappings using leader key. It also facilitates remembering of shortcuts by providing mental separation for the ones you’ve crafted yourself. To activate a shortcut you just press leader key and than a specific mapping, e.g. I use <code>&lt;leader&gt;w</code> to save current file. Configuring such a mapping is quite easy: add <code>map &lt;leader&gt;w</code> to your .vimrc and you’re done. Noticing things you do repeatedly working day-to-day in Vim and creating custom mappings for them will allow you to save a little bit of time constantly and will make editing with Vim more effortless.</p>
<p>Lots of Vim tutorials recommend to use <code>,</code> as leader key. However I see a few benefits of using spacebar instead.</p>
<h2 id="it-doesnt-override-any-default-vim-mappings">It doesn’t override any default Vim mappings</h2>
<p>Contrary to <code>,</code>, which is used to move cursor to previous occurrence of a character navigated to using <code>t</code> or <code>f</code>, space doesn’t do any particularly useful in normal mode by default. Yes, it does move cursor to the next character, but the motion is already covered by <code>l</code> key anyway (or an arrow key if you like to use those). So we could safely override default space behaviour. <code>,</code> is quite important for my workflow on the opposite side.</p>
<h2 id="space-is-easy-to-reach-to">Space is easy to reach to</h2>
<p>Most of your custom mappings will use leader key, so it should be better easy to type. Spacebar is a huge key placed very conveniently on most keyboards. It’s a safe bet regarding ergonomics.</p>
<h2 id="space-is-symmetrical">Space is symmetrical</h2>
<p>This one alone is a good reason for me to use spacebar as my leader key. Given it’s <em>equally</em> easily reachable for <em>both hands</em>, space leaves me with all the alphanumeric keys as convenient shortcut options. Again in contrast to <code>,</code> which is typed by the right hand making left hand letters more comfortable options for typing shortcuts without stretching fingers.</p>
<p>There’s even a text editor (a flavour of Emacs) based around the idea of space key as a gateway to all the editor commands called <a href="http://spacemacs.org">Spacemacs</a>. I’ve been playing around with it a little bit recently and it has been positive experience so far. Spacemacs goes one step further by providing instant visual feedback about available commands once you’ve pressed space key.</p>
<h2 id="think-for-yourself">Think for yourself</h2>
<p>This way to use leader key fits <em>my</em> workflow very well. It may or may not be as efficient in your case. Be critical of that “mappings every Vimmer should use” tips (and of this article as well). Try what works best for <em>you</em>, your fingers and your keyboard. If you’re interested more in how I use Vim check out my <a href="https://github.com/raindev/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> GitHub repo. Happy editing!</p>
